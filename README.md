# Online Proctoring Challenge

## Description
As the Covid-19 pandemic has effected the world, the need for online education solutions is far greater. As such, online testing introduces new challenges around proctoring and honesty of test takers.

You will build an Online test taking platform that includes automated proctoring. The system will need to know when a student may be not paying attention to the test, or doing other prohibited activities. You will be provided a base video streaming file that can be used as an input. This video will contain multiple offenses that your system will be expected to detect.
